# chat-bot
Working development with a basic chat bot in Python.
In essence, this chat bot has a set list of responses based on its "mood", a state dependent on user input of their own mood.
It asks them about how they feel about their work today, and will prompt them to respond, with the bot responding in kind from a preselected set of answers.
If the user inputs good-bye, the program closes.
